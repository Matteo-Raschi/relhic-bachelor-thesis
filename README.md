This thesis explores the possibility that there are invisible structures in the universe, made of dark matter, that contain gas but no stars. These objects are called Reionization-Limited HI Clouds (RELHICs). According to current theories, they may have formed in the early universe but never created stars because the gas inside them stayed too hot or too sparse. To search for these hidden structures, in our universe, I used data from a large radio telescope survey called "FAST all sky HI survey" (FASHI), which looks for hydrogen gas in emission. I compared these radio signals with a map of visible galaxies from the SDSS project. When a radio source was found that didnâ€™t have a matching optical object, it became a potential candidate for one of these dark halos. After applying a set of selection criteria, namely, a narrow HI line width ($W_{50} \leq 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$, including uncertainties), low neutral hydrogen mass ($\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{HI}}/M_\odot) < 9$), nearly circular morphology ($b/a > 0.8$), significant isolation (distance to nearest galaxy $> 500\,\mathrm{kpc}$), and moderate integrated HI flux ($S_{\mathrm{bf}} \leq 3000\,\mathrm{mJy\,km/s}$, within errors), I studied the filtered sample using statistical tools and graphical analysis.
. The results show that many of these sources have properties that match what we expect for RELHICs. While more detailed observations are needed to elucidate the nature of this objects, this work helps take the first steps toward discovering and cataloging these hidden systems of the universe.
